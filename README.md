# Common Errors

## JavaScript

- `TypeError: 'x' is not iterable`: `x` is not an array. You're trying to run a loop on `x` which is not an array.
- `ReferenceError: 'x' is not defined`: the variable, constant, or function `x` does not exist in the current scope or in any of the parents' scopes.
- `Cannot read property x of undefined`: you're trying to read the property `x` of something that is not an object, but is rather undefined.
